# **Road Safety Traffic Control Alert Using Deep Learning**

## **Overview**

This project involves developing a traffic control alert system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for real-time traffic report analysis. The system aims to enhance road safety by providing timely alerts and insights based on traffic conditions.

## **Features**

- **Real-Time Analysis:** Utilizes CNNs to analyze traffic reports and images for real-time monitoring.
- **Traffic Alerts:** Generates alerts for traffic conditions and potential safety issues.
- **Enhanced Safety:** Improves road safety through timely and accurate traffic management.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/Keras
- **Libraries:** OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Version Control:** Git

## **Usage**

1. **Run the application:** Start the traffic control alert system by executing the main script.
2. **Input Data:** Provide traffic images or reports for analysis.
3. **Receive Alerts:** The system will output traffic alerts and safety recommendations.

## **Dataset**

- The model was trained on a dataset of traffic images and reports.
- Dataset details and preprocessing instructions are available in the `data` directory.

## **Results**

- The system effectively provides real-time traffic analysis and alerts, contributing to enhanced road safety.
- Performance metrics and alert results are available in the `results` directory.
